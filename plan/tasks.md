# 6-Day Implementation Plan for Basic Vector Search Engine Project
This comprehensive plan outlines how to successfully complete the vector search engine project within a 6-day timeframe, breaking down the development process into manageable daily objectives with specific technical details.

## Day 1: Project Setup and Planning
### Milestones
- Define the project's scope and objectives.
- Set up the development environment (e.g., install necessary software, initialize version control).
- Plan the system architecture and technical stack (e.g., backend framework, database, vectorization method).

### Key Tasks
- Write down detailed requirements and break them into smaller tasks.
- Create a project timeline with SMART goals for each day.

### Output
A clear roadmap and a functional development environment.

## Day 2: Core Functionality Development
### Milestones
- Implement document ingestion (e.g., upload and preprocess documents).
- Develop vectorization logic (e.g., TF-IDF or SentenceBERT for embeddings).
- Set up database schema for storing metadata and vectors.

### Key Tasks
- Write code for the `/ingest` endpoint.
- Test vector generation with sample documents.

### Output
Working ingestion pipeline with vector storage.

## Day 3: Search Functionality Implementation
### Milestones
- Implement the `/search` endpoint to handle queries.
- Develop similarity calculation logic (e.g., cosine similarity).
- Optimize search ranking and result formatting.

### Key Tasks
- Write query preprocessing functions.
- Test search functionality with sample queries.

### Output
Functional search API returning ranked results.

## Day 4: Advanced Features Integration
### Milestones
- Add pagination to search results.
- Implement filtering options based on metadata.
- Develop the `/document/:id` endpoint to retrieve individual documents.

### Key Tasks
- Enhance the ranking algorithm for better relevance.
- Test pagination and filtering features thoroughly.

### Output
Enhanced search capabilities with advanced user options.

## Day 5: Optimization and Testing
### Milestones
- Optimize vector storage and retrieval using FAISS or similar tools.
- Conduct performance testing with large datasets.
- Write unit and integration tests for all endpoints.

### Key Tasks
- Identify bottlenecks in search performance and address them.
- Ensure security measures are in place (e.g., input sanitization).

### Output
Optimized system ready for deployment.

## Day 6: Final Refinements and Deployment
### Milestones
- Refactor code for maintainability and scalability.
- Document the system architecture, API endpoints, and deployment steps.
- Deploy the project to a production environment.

### Key Tasks
- Conduct final end-to-end testing to ensure functionality.
- Prepare Docker containers or other deployment configurations.

### Output
Fully deployed project with complete documentation.

## Technical Stack
1. **Backend Framework**: Node.js with Express
2. **Database**: MongoDB
3. **Vectorization**: TF-IDF or SentenceBERT
4. **Similarity Search**: Cosine similarity; FAISS for optimization
5. **Tools**: Postman (API testing), Jest (unit testing), Docker (deployment)

By following this plan, you can systematically achieve your project goals within six days while maintaining focus on key milestones each day.
